- if no source to harvest, and linkFrom is empty, and there's energy in storage - get energy from storage to linkFrom
- refactor JS sources
- check that flags do exist before creating uptown creeps
- check that there is anything to build before spawning builders (IN PROGRESS) - `HelpersFind.findSomethingToBuild().length > 0`
- claimers should `reserveController` after claiming it
- add extractor in room 2
- add extractor in room 3 (later)
- make upgraders wait near the appropriate link in room 1 and 2
- do not spawn upgraders unless there is enough energy in links and both extensions and spawn are full
