- if no source to harvest, and linkFrom is empty, and there's energy in storage - get energy from storage to linkFrom
- refactor JS sources
- check that flags do exist before creating uptown creeps
- check that there is anything to build before spawning builders (IN PROGRESS) - `HelpersFind.findSomethingToBuild().length > 0`
- claimers should `reserveController` after claiming it
- add extractor in room 3 (later)
- make upgraders wait near the appropriate link in room 1 and 2
- do not spawn upgraders unless there is enough energy in links and both extensions and spawn are full
- use husky to run compile hook before commiting/pushing
- maybe make creeps don't stand where other creeps want to go while they are just waiting
- make creeps to seek for more energy if totalCarry is not maxed out only if it's convenient or there's any energy available
- make all creeps to pickup dropped resources if it's convenient (close enough) and to dump it appropriately (minerals, etc.)
- rebuild destroyed walls
- attack the healer, otherwise they will just keep on healing the wall destroyer
- don't try to upgrgrade controller over 15 energy per tick, see https://docs.screeps.com/api/#Creep.upgradeController:~:text=A%20fully%20upgraded%20level%208%20controller%20can%27t%20be%20upgraded%20over%2015%20energy%20units%20per%20tick%20regardless%20of%20creeps%20abilities.%20The%20cumulative%20effect%20of%20all%20the%20creeps%20performing%20upgradeController%20in%20the%20current%20tick%20is%20taken%20into%20account.%20This%20limit%20can%20be%20increased%20by%20using%20ghodium%20mineral%20boost.
